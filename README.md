The aim of this project was to compare the effectiveness of two of three stochastic minimization algorithms:
Pure Random Search (PRS), Multi-Start (MS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). We decided on the Random Search algorithm and
Multiple Start Method. The analysis was performed on Ackley and Rastrigin functions with different values
number of dimensions: 2, 10 and 20.
